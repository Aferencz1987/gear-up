# Bouncing Forward: Resilience at Turing
Resilience is the ability to bounce back from adversity. It is a necessary skill for coping with lifeâ€™s inevitable obstacles and one of the key ingredients to success. When we apply resilience through the positive psychology lens,
the learning is not only to bounce back, but to bounce forward.

## Relationship to Turing Mission
*Our mission is to unlock human potential by training a diverse, inclusive student body to succeed in high-fulfillment technical careers.*

Psychological resilience is the ability to experience potentially traumatic events and challenges and come through stronger, wiser, and more flexible. Research over the last 30 years has indicated individuals' ability to thrive  is less a matter of being spared challenges and personal difficulties; rather, it is shaped by how individuals respond to challenges -- whether they focus on how terrible the events are or view them as opportunities to grow.

While stressors can affect individuals' quality of life, researchers now understand there are *protective* factors that have almost as much (if not more) influence on how challenging events shape peoples' lives. The *skill* of resilience is one of those factors.

In order to advance Turing's mission, it's important to help students develop resilience. We regularly hear from employers that they value employees that are hungry to learn new skills, communicate effectively, and work well on teams. This work is emotionally demanding and draining. In order to position our students to be successful during their time at Turing and in their career afterwards, they must have skills to weather the personal and professional stressors they'll encounter so they can sustain high levels of performance in these areas. 

Given Turing's commitment to advancing diversity in the field, resilience will also help students manage the stress and emotional demands of advancing diversity and inclusion in difficult conversations and environments.

## Goal of Session
Identify personal strategies for developing resilience and articulate ways we can support each other in this work at Turing.

## Discuss (15 min)
1. Brainstorm an example of resiliency (That you've seen or experienced)
1. Write it on board (we will need additional whiteboard markers)
1. In small groups, discuss commonalities
1. List traits and add them to the board
At the end, we should have a white board filled with examples of resilience + resilience characteristics

## Strategies (25 min)
1. Break into 7 groups
1. Distribute one skill to each group
1. Groups discuss how skill relates to resilience
1. Groups present to class about their skill

## Survey (5 min)
