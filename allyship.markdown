# Allyship Intro (5 min)

In previous GearUps, we've explored the ways in which we can unwittingly participate in behavior that alienates or perpetuates inequality and injustice in our workplaces and communities. What opportunities, if any, do you have to address these issues when you encounter them? How can we use our relationships and daily interactions to effectively challenge cultural and systemic discrimination?

"Allyship" is when a person of privilege seeks to operate in solidarity with and support a marginalized group of people. Allyship is not a badge of honor that you wear or something that you achieve.  It is an ongoing process that you have to continually work to develop over time.  A foundational step in allyship is educating yourself first and then developing relationships with people in different identity groups.  It is not about going to a person of another group and asking them to educate you.  

Today, we will discuss some essays on the topic of allyship.  In any conversation about identity, we recognize that people will have different experiences and responses to the topics based on how you personally identify.  Today we want to create a space where we set a few norms during discussions.

Facilitator: please write norms on the board.  After reviewing norms, ask students if they would like to see any other norms added. 

### Norms
* Listen first before responding
* Seek to understand others
* Assume positive intent
* Share the air

## Structure

* You should already be in your assigned small group
* You'll read independently for about 12 minutes
* You'll then independently process through writing for another 12 minutes
* Finally you'll come together as a small group to discuss

## Reading (~12 Minutes)

Your small group should have copies of the articles listed below. The expectation is that
during this period you'll read at least two of these, but it can be any two.

* [White Anti-Racism: Living the Legacy](http://www.tolerance.org/supplement/white-anti-racism-living-legacy)  
* [11 Things White People Can Do To Be Real Anti-Racist Allies](http://www.alternet.org/news-amp-politics/11-things-white-people-can-do-be-real-anti-racist-allies)  
* [Emma Watson: Gender Equality is Your Issue Too](http://www.unwomen.org/en/news/stories/2014/9/emma-watson-gender-equality-is-your-issue-too)  
* [Being an Ally: 10 Things Every ‘Ally’ Needs to Remember](http://everydayfeminism.com/2013/11/things-allies-need-to-know/)  
* [Making Tech Spaces Safe for Diverse Faces](https://modelviewculture.com/pieces/making-tech-spaces-safe-for-diverse-faces)

## Writing (~12 Minutes)

Next, process your thinking through writing.

The scenarios listed below have all been reported to have happened here at Turing. Read through each scenario and write your answers to these guestions:

* How could you be an ally in this situation?
* If you are a member of the targeted group, how would you want an ally to respond in this situation?
* What effect would it have to ignore the situation?


### Scenario 1

A group of Turing students are planning to walk in the Pride parade this summer and has opened the invitation to all students.  While working on your project, one of your team member says that they wish all the talk about gay pride would be over and that it is a distraction to what we are all trying to do here at Turing.  

### Scenario 2

You know there are several people in your cohort who don't drink, but come Thursday, most of your friends want to go to a bar down the street. It's someone's birthday today, so your cohort's "social coordinator" invites everyone out, but you know there are several people who won't be comfortable being at a bar.

### Scenario 3

One of your friends is talking about one of the Joan Clarke events for women students that they attended. A student in your cohort, who does not identify as a woman, says that it is unfair that such exclusive groups exist. They would like to be able to take part in those group's events as well.

### Scenario 4

You're working in your first job after Turing. Aware of issues around diversity in tech, you realize that all the developers on your team all share the same background. There's more diversity on the sales/operations team, but the dev team is a true monoculture. You ask your team lead "hey, have you thought about trying to build more diversity into the team?" and they reply "yeah, we'd love to have some women and maybe people of color, but we just haven't seen any with the right skills and we're not willing to lower our standards."


## Discussion (~20 Minutes)
Introduce yourself to your group by sharing your name, your cohort/program, and your hometown.  

Within your group, consider these questions:

* Go through each scenario above and share how you responded.  What are the implications of different responses?
* What's one time you acted as an ally here at Turing? What's one time someone acted as an ally for you here at Turing?
* In a previous GearUp, we discussed the concept of "microaggressions" and understanding spaces where we have privilege. Is a small act of allyship is the opposite of a microaggression and/or is it using your privilege for good? Does action at this small level really make a difference? What are larger actions an ally can do?
* Proponents of the allyship lens of social responsibility would argue that focusing on this scale is a viable way of changing large-scale systemic issues. Do you agree? 

## Debrief: (~15 Minutes)

As a whole group, come together to discuss two final questions.  What does it take to be an ally at Turing?  What will it take for you to continue to being an ally in your software development career?
