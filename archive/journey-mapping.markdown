# Journey Mapping

## Mission Alignment
*Our mission is to unlock human potential by training a diverse, inclusive student body to succeed in high-fulfillment technical careers.*

Being able to empathize with end users is a skill that leads to better software and better services. At Turing, we structure our curriculum to provide hundreds of opportunities to interact with others in ways that help students build the skills then need to envision end users goals and needs. An ability to empathize and put yourself in others' shoes is at the heart of this work.

Today we will be focused on a specific process that supports user-centered design: user journey mapping. User journey mapping involves several steps: capturing details about users' experiences with interviews and focus groups, organizing the data in a journey map (we'll review map formats later on), and reviewing the map for strengths and opportunities for improvements.


## Goal of Session
By the end of this session, students should be able to do the following.
* Discover tactics for understanding others' experiences and practice asking these questions in a focused activity.
* Practice empathy to identify thoughts and feelings of others
* Construct a journey map to document others' experiences


## Progression

* Interview Round I: pair A/B interviews pair C/D (15 min)
* Interview Round II: pair C/D interviews pair A/B (15 min)
* Mapping (15 min)
* Survey (5 min)


## Introduction
What is a journey map? Review these two examples, both of which document users' experience with tech services ([Broadband Provider Journey](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/1-broadband-provider-journey-large-opt.jpg), [Healthrageous Player Journey](http://uxmastery.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/hr_journey-high-res.jpg)).

We will then watch this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_ErfXWckjI) from the United States Digital Service (USDS) that demonstrates a part of the user interview process. The full story of the USDS's redesign of the Veteran's Affairs (VA) health care web experience is outlined here, [Introducing a New Digital Application for Health Care at VA](https://medium.com/the-u-s-digital-service/introducing-a-new-digital-application-for-healthcare-at-va-610d8bac4c78#.n5ee0di4d).


## Pair Up and Pick Topics (5 min)
Students start in groups of 4 and will need to divide again into pairs (pair A/B and pair C/D). Each pair should decide on a user experience they can both attest to and have experienced personally.

When picking a user experience for your pair, pick a journey that has a beginning and end, and a product or well-defined bounds that the user is interacting with. Examples include:

  * Taking public transportation to work/school for the first time
  * Getting a Colorado drivers license
  * Filing an insurance claim after a car accident
  * Buying items from Amazon Pantry
  * Making the decision to attend Turing 
  * Participating in first portfolio review 
  * Participating in Improv on the second day of M1 
  * Completing your first programming project at Turing
  * Discovering programming for the first time 
  * Pairing for the first time 
  * Completing an assessment with an instructor

While you may enjoy focusing on tech-related experiences, feel free to chose other topics. You can practice the targeted skills of this exercise (asking questions, empathizing, and discovering the intimacies of another person's experience) across a varied set of topics.


## Interview Round I (15 min)
For the first round of interviews, pair A/B will interview pair C/D. It's recommended that A interviews C and B interviews D in order to extract the most detail possible about the experience.

Using "getting a Colorado drivers license" as an example, these are some questions that may help interviewers drive the conversation.
  * When did you first realize you need to get a drivers license?
  * How long passed before realizing you needed a new license and taking your first step toward getting a new license? What prompted you to start taking action?
  * How did you figure out where to go to get a license?
  * Etc.


## Interview Round II (15 min)
For the second round of interviews, pair C/D will interview pair A/B. It's recommended that C interviews A and D interviews B...


## Mapping (15 min)
Now that both pairs have some primary data from their interviews, start organizing the details you gleaned into a journey map format. You may find the following sequence helpful.

1. **Clarify the scope of your map:** Where did the journey begin and when does it end?
2. **Identify phases of the journey:** What logical groupings can you make around the series of steps your user took?
3. **Capture user's steps to achieve goal:** What actions did your user take to achieve their goal ?
4. **Thoughts and feelings:** What parts are joyful? What parts are frustrating? What emotions and thoughts did your user experience over the course of their journey?
5. **Pain Points**: What moments and actions were most frustrating or difficult for your user.

By the end of the session, take a photo of your groups journey maps and tweet with the hashtag `#turingjm`.
