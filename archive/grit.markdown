# Grit Mindset
## Mission Alignment

*Our mission is to unlock human potential by training a diverse, inclusive student body to succeed in high-fulfillment technical careers.*

Most students at Turing seem to share a high level of grit, defined as "perseverance and passion for long-term goals." Grit helps students consistently engage and reengage learning opportunities and challenges that are often difficult and frustrating. When we envision the challenges students will face in the field (tackling new problems, mastering new material), grit also appears to be a mindset that students need to succeed after they graduate.

For that reason, we've included grit as a key mindset for students at Turing, and our curriculum is designed to help students cultivate this attitude. However, while we can encourage students to develop passion and practice sticking with difficult material, deep grit depends on students' ownership of their struggle and their ability to adjust their attitude and remind themselves of their passions and motivations when they feel discouraged.

Today's exercise is designed to develop students' awareness of grit and relate it to their experiene at Turing. If grit is not a relevant concept for you, you will want to use this session to clarify why it is not, and reflect on how you will need to manage your attitude in the face of Turing's formidable challenges.

## Goals of Session
* Students will be able to define grit and articulate the role that passion plays in sustaining grit
* Students will be able to articulate how grit is a function of behaviors and attitudes, not a fixed quality
* Students will be able to apply the concept of grit to module-specific professional challenges they'll face in the coming inning or in their job search.

## Introductions (5 min)
* Introduce yourself to the group (name, Module, program, your current favorite song)

## Watch (7 min)
Together, we will watch grit researcher Angela Duckworth's TEDTalk, ["Grit: The Power of Passion and Perseverance."](https://www.ted.com/talks/angela_lee_duckworth_grit_the_power_of_passion_and_perseverance#t-85401)

## Read (13 min)
Independently, we will read these articles.
* ["Donâ€™t Believe the Hype About Grit, Pleads the Scientist Behind the Concept"](http://nymag.com/scienceofus/2016/05/dont-believe-the-hype-about-grit-pleads-the-scientist-behind-the-concept.html) (*New York Magazine*, May 9, 2016)
* ["Four Signs You Have Grit](http://motto.time.com/4327035/4-signs-you-have-grit/) (*Motto*, May 12, 2016)

## Write (10 min)
Reflect independently in your notebook on these questions.

### Everyone
Think of a time at Turing when you've been tempted to give up.
* How did your grit come into play? 
* Have you been able to strengthen your grit (or your grittiness) in your time at Turing?
* Is it in any way problematic to think about challenges through the lens of grit (ex: emphasizing pushing through when you really need a break)?


### Module 2
Now that you're a bit acclimated to the challenges and routine of being a student at Turing, you probably can relate to both getting gritty and having your grit weaken. "[Looking] for ways to make your work more meaningful" is one of the elements Hilmantel focuses on in ["Four Signs You Have Grit"](http://motto.time.com/4327035/4-signs-you-have-grit/). Reread this section, and brainstorm 2-3 ways you can imbue your work over the next week and next module to be more "filled with purpose."

### Module 3
As you head into the homestretch of your time at Turing and begin to look toward your job search, it will be helpful to begin to articulate the things that, in Hilmantel's words, you can find "enduringly fascinating."
* What parts of your experience at Turing has lit that fire?
* Brainstorm 4-5 descriptions of work that really engages you (algorithmically complex challenges, imagining user needs and creating something elegant and enjoyable to use, designing backend architecture to support open-ended specification).
* How can you create opportunities to build around the work that engages you in your remaining time at Turing?


## Group Work
 Ensure that the following roles are delegated to members of your group.

| Role | Description |
|--------|-----------|
| **Timekeeper** | Ensure that the group has a chance to address all the discussion questions|
| **Facilitator** | Works with the timekeeper to move through the discussion questions. Solicits input from all members of the group and helps individuals be aware if they are dominating the conversation.|
| **Notetaker** | Take the notes!|
| **Spokesperson** | Keeps track of the topics discussed, and is prepared to represent the group when it's time for each group to report out the highlights of their conversation. |


### Discussion (15 min)
1. Begin by sharing your current definition or exposure to grit. 
 * "I've read a lot about grit, particularly about how it can be really dangerous when applied in an educational context. It can be used to put pressure on students to suck it up and get through the work, instead of equipping them to tackle the sources of some of their difficulties"
 * "My dad always uses grit as a way to complement someone. It means being tough, sucking it up, not whining."
2. Facilitator move your group into answering your module specific questions.  Be sure that everyone has an opportunity to share.
3. Timekeeper: Announce when you have 2 minutes left in your discussion.  Facilitator:  Help your group come up with the 1-2 ideas you want to share whole group or a summary of what your group discussed. 

### Groups Report Out (10 min)
Spokesperson from each group will report out the top 1-2 reflections that came from their writing and discussion.

### Closing (1 min)
Facilitator synthesize the reflections and connect back to learning goals for the session.
