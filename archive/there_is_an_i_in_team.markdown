## There is an "I" in "Team"

### Introduction (5 min) 
As a member of a team, it may often feel like you are the unwitting victim of team dynamics, but it's much more effective to appreciate the role each individual member (including you) plays in creating and perpetuating team systems, rhythms, habits, norms, and expectations. 

Working effectively on teams requires more than just making sure your own work gets done. It requires teammembers to be aware of and address their teammates' needs and the team's needs as a whole. 

Today we will construct two team discussions to help you reflect on team dynamics, your role in them, and tactics for engaging teams effectively. 

### Discussion (10 min)
In your assigned group, pick one of the following questions and discuss for 10 minutes. 
* Who is someone who makes or made you feel special and why/how?
* What is something you make or create on a daily basis?
* Do you believe in ghosts? Why or why not?

### Writing (10 min)
Reflect privately on these questions about the discussion you just had.
* What was your first reaction to the question?
* Before sharing, did you take into account how others might react to what you say? How did that make you feel and how did it affect your feelings toward the group?
* Was there anything that bothered you about your dynamic as a group? How might _you_ have contributed to that dynamic? How did _others_ contribute to that dynamic?

### Video (5 min)
Dr. Brene Brown is a shame and vulnerability researcher[1] whose work touches on key themes that may have surfaced during the beginning of this session. Together, we will watch her video, [Boundaries, Empathy, and Compassion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecb6ExBaW80), and incorporate some of her ideas into our further conversation. 

As we watch the video, take note of the connection Dr. Brown makes between boundaries and one's ability to compassionately engage others. Consider how personal boundaries and compassion might translate into team expectations and norms. 

### Discussion (25 min)
As a group, we're going to continue to dive deeper into the topic of team dynamics, starting by putting some of these ideas into practice. *Elect someone in your group to take notes* and post your answers to the questions below to Slack at the end of the session. It would also be helpful to *designate a timekeeper* to help the group stay on track. 

First, take a moment to _re_-define the relationship (DTR) as a group by practicing empathy and setting boundaries that respect the varying needs of members of your team.

Allow people in the group to share what their goals for the group are and what concerns or observations they have about the group's earlier dynamic. As you go *round-robin*, restate the previous person's contribution and reflect (briefly) on what _you_ will do to continue or improve that dynamic _before_ you share your own idea. (5 min)

With those expectations redefined, tackle the following discussion topics as a group. (20 min)
* What has been your most successful team experience? 
* What qualities do your teammember's most successful teams share?
* What norms and expectations (stated or unstated) contribute to successful teams' efficacy? 
* In what ways can you contribute to these norms and expectations? 

### Survey (5 min)
Please fill out the [survey linked here](https://goo.gl/forms/VTWUbuuSfKycRXrz1). We've also included some reflection questions to help you process the final round of discussions you had with your team.

* What did it feel like having to repeat your teammate's comments at the beginning of the exercise and state how you would address his or her concerns? How could or would this skill benefit you in a team setting?
* How was the dynamic of your first conversation different that the second conversation? What concerns or frustrations, if any, remained?
