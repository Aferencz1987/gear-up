# Microaggressions 101: Building Understanding

## Mission Alignment
*Our mission is to unlock human potential by training a diverse, inclusive student body to succeed in high-fulfillment technical careers.*

A female Turing student attends a local networking event and is speaking with a company rep. She asks if they are hiring, and he says, "we’re mostly hiring developers, but we have a lot of other roles” and he goes on to list their sales and marketing positions. It's clear to the student that he assumed she didn't have technical skills. She clarifies that she's actually looking for a developer job. "Good for you," he says. "That's really awesome." Though small and subtle, encounters like this carry an implicit message that women don't belong in tech roles. 

The above scenario describes a microaggression, which is defined as a "subtle but offensive comment or action directed at a minority or other nondominant group that is often unintentional or unconsciously reinforces a stereotype." This term was first coined in the 1970s but its application today can sometimes be confusing. The goal of today's session is to unpack this term and help us recognize our roles in addressing them.

Turing has a mission-critical responsibility to create a culture in which the messages behind microaggressions are consistently named and challenged. This culture has immediate consequences for students in our program who are more likely to be targets of microaggressions. There are long-term advantages as well; by cultivating student empathy for the effects of these subtle messages, this culture also helps all students practice and develop skills to be more effective advocates for underrepresented groups in tech after they graduate.

## Goal of Session
By the end of this session, students should be able to do the following:
* Understand what "microaggressions" are and what they might look like
* Build an understanding of what type of action is aligned with your values when it comes to addressing microaggressions
* Practice empathy for both targets of microaggressions and those who communicate microaggressions through conversation

## Write (10 min)
Reflect on the articles from above:

* What are some takeaways from the articles?
* How does this information change or reinforce what you thought about the topic of microaggressions at the outset of this session?
* What questions do you still have about this topic and how it relates to your life? 

## Discuss (25 min)
Before you begin discussing this topic, ensure that the following roles are delegated to members of your group.

| Role | Description |
|--------|-----------|
| **Timekeeper** | Ensure that the group has a chance to address all the discussion questions and time at the end to complete the survey.|
| **Facilitator** | Works with the timekeeper to move through the discussion questions. Solicits input from all members of the group and helps individuals be aware if they are dominating the conversation.|
| **Participant (all)** | Listens actively, is respectful and engaged, takes responsibility for all members having a chance to share their perspectives and learn from others. |

Allow each person in your group 2 minutes to share their reactions to the writing prompt above. Then, use the following prompt to focus on for the rest of your time.

**Building Understanding**: Pick one of Chee's encounters from "A Month of Microaggressions" and reflect on how that episode would affect you if you were Chee. Use these questions to guide your discussion:

* What makes this encounter a microaggression? Why? 
* How would you feel, physically and/or emotionally, immediately after this encounter?
* How do you feel about the person who directed that comment at you? 
* How could you build empathy for that person?
* How would you recover from the incident? Assuming the incident was somewhat upsetting, what process would you go through to get back to how you felt beforehand?
* Are there any potential action steps you could take the next time you have an encounter like this? How could you help the commenter understand how to take accountability for their comment?
