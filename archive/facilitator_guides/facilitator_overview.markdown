# Facilitator Overview

#### 1. Beginning of discussion
  * Introduce yourself, describe the role you plan to take.
  * Invite others to introduce themselves and what they hope to get out of the discussion.
  * Set expectations. Ask for input from others about ground rules/guidelines for discussion. Frame it positively, i.e. “What makes for a good discussion, how can we build that in today?” 
  * Invite someone in the group to keep track of time and lead the discussion. ​_These are not your jobs; it’s your job to make sure someone takes ownership of the role._​


#### 2. Facilitate: i.e. during discussion, maintain low profile, take responsibility for intervening if/when necessary:
  * If someone withdraws and seems to be disengaging, invite them to share their perspective or name a topic for the group to discuss
  * If someone is monopolizing, ask the group to pause and invite others to share. 
  * If the group agrees on most things, challenge them/push them to some discomfort: If they agree this is important, where can they do more? Where is it hardest for them to implement these ideas? 
  * If the group has some division, get more involved. Encourage people to share from their own experience, avoid general statements. Bring people back to the shared goals they agreed on in the beginning.


#### 3. At the end, ​*have a quick debrief.*​ 
  * Ask people to share their biggest takeaway. 
  * Consider doing the +/change exercise (what do you want to do again? what would you change?) as a way to critically reflect and have closure.
