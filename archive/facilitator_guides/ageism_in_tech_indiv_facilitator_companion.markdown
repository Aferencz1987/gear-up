### Discussion (30 min)
* _It may be helpful to do a quick_ *vocabular review* _here: What is an institution? (a company, an industry, a subset of an industry, a social convention, i.e. marriage) and What do we mean by individual actions? (interactions, choices you make in your day to do life)_  

* *Assign a timekeeper* and a *notetaker*. _It is_ *strongly* _encouraged that you take notes on a white-board or big post-it -- these props help your group process the discussion and internalize takeaways._  

### Recap (5 min)
_The goal of recap is to synthesize the topics you've discussed. Consider reading through what your notetaker captured from your discussion. If you gave your group time to reflect privately on the last topic, this may be a good time for everyone to report out their ideas._

### Complete Surveys (5 min)
_The facilitator is responsible for ensuring that everyone in their group fills out the survey. Make time for it -- even if it means cutting the discussion short. Two reasons the survey is important: 1) It will give you some information about how your group management was perceived by the others, and 2) It will help set a tone of reverence for mod 1-3 student toward GearUp as a whole -- a small legacy you can leave behind.)_
