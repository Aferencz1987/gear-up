# Don't Listen To Your Parents

## Plan

* 5 Minutes: Read the excerpt *twice* by yourself
* 10 Minutes: Complete the exercises by yourself
* 10 Minutes: Follow the discussion plan with your small group
* Closing: Gather back together as a whole group to wrap the discussion

## Reading (8 Minutes)

You'll have a printed copy of an excerpt titled "Don't Listen To Your Parents" from Chad Fowler's "The Passionate Programmer". Read the essay, the follow-up about Tom Preston-Werner, then dive into the writing below.

## Writing (12 Minutes)

Spent about 12 minutes writing on the following topics:

* What career expectations are placed on you by your family or the people most important to you? Is attending Turing in line with or counter to those expectations? Why?
* If you stayed on your "old path", whatever you were doing before, where would you have gone in the next five years? Why did you decide to walk away from that?
* How long will you be a "programmer"? Your whole career? Just a year or two? Why? What kind of role do you want to be in 10 years down the road? Will you need to change companies over time, or do you think you can grow within one?
* Thinking about the Tom Preston-Werner story, would you be able to walk away from a guaranteed big thing to try out a possibly big thing? Who do you know that you'd want to work with through the darkest, hardest days of starting a company? Would you make it? Are you cut out for a startup? Why or why not?
* What's your tolerance for risk? Clearly coming to Turing is a risk. What if it doesn't pan out? What would radical, almost unimaginable success look like if your risks pay off? What stands between where you are now and that picture of success?

## Discussion (15 Minutes)

Last let's get together with your small group and discuss some of those writing questions.

* Where do you see the most commonality? Where are the greatest differences?
* What surprises you about your peers thoughts/fears?
* Who has the biggest dreams?
