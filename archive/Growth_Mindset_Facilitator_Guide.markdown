# Turing Career Development: Growth Mindset

[PPT](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B51t9-cqjZR7TGZaVnd2aUtyQVU/view)

## SESSION OUTCOMES

* Learn what a "growth mindset" is and how it will help them succeed at Turing and in the tech industry
* Identify individual strategies to deal with stresses that trigger a "fixed mindset"
* Identify group strategies for supporting each others' growth mindset

## GROUPING
  
  * What should the group size be for discussions? (Recommend 3-4)
  * How should groups be set up? (Recommend some meaningful grouping)

## Pre Reading 
Send pre-reading out at least 24 hours before the session

## Logistics and Set Up

| Set Up | Materials Needed | PPT Link (if PPT)|
| ------ | ---------------- | ---------------- |
| Ensure that chairs are set up in small groups of 3-4. Have participants sit in mixed groups.    | Participants need notebooks, pens.  Ensure you have microphone for panel. | "[PPT] (https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B51t9-cqjZR7ZVhtZFM3djcwY3c)" |
| Set up 4-5 chairs for your panel in front of the room  | Arrange for panel participants at least 1 week ahead of time.  Send them the questions you will ask them ahead of time.  |  |
| Survey Questions to send or add to academic survey  | 1) What value would you assign to this session (from 1-5)? <br> 2) What are you taking away from this session? <br> 3) How do you think this session will change your approach to your time at Turing and in the tech industry?  | LINK TO GOOGLE SURVEY |

#SESSION OUTLINE

| Timing        | Facilitator Talking Points           | Participant/Facilitator Actions  |
| ------------- | ------------- | ----- |
| 5 min      |  Introduction: Welcome participants.  Introduce yourself and your role.  Review the outcomes for the session and the connection to the greater Turing mission.  Ask students to introduce themselves to their small group if they do not know each other.  | What should participants be doing during this section? |
| 15 min | Introduce Carol Dweck's Ted Talk "Carol Dweck is a researcher...blah, blah, blah.  We will watch this video.  During the video, consider your own understanding of growth mindset and how it is similar or different from how Carol explains it."  "[The Power of Believing that You Can Improve](https://www.ted.com/talks/carol_dweck_the_power_of_believing_that_you_can_improve)." |  Students should take notes during the video.  Ask them to put away cell phones/computers if needed. |
| 5 min | In notebooks, reflect on the following questions. <br> 1) How do you think past experiences or experiences this week that have encouraged growth or fixed mindsets? <br> 2) What are your triggers, what's likely to move you to fixed mindset? <br> 3) What can you peers do to support you staying in the growth mindset?" | Facilitator: walk the room while students write|
| 15 min | In groups of 3, identify a timekeeper, a faciliator, and a notetaker.  Each student should spend about 2 minutes sharing what surfaced during their writing. After individual sharing, the groups together should tackle the question: how can you support each other in creating a cohort culture that supports growth mindset. You might draw on Dweck's suggestions from the article you read.| Facilitator: walk the room and listen to group discussions.  Identify a few key points or themes from the small group discussions that you might want to share with the whole group |
| 25 min | Transition the whole group by either sharing a few quick points from discussions or by using an attention getter to switch gears.  <br> Share framing of the panel, "We want you to hear from a few people who have experienced Turing and have been challenged to maintain a growth mindset.  Each of these panel members has their own experiences and we are excited to hear their reflections today."  <br>  Introduce each of the panel members OR have them introduce themselves.  | Facilitator: prompt the panel with each of the questions.  You might have students write questions on notecards or save some time for Q&A from the audience. |
|  5 min |  Close the session with reviewing the outcomes and highlighting a few talking points from the panel.  Remind students they can take some time in their retro this afternoon to share reflections. |  |



### Questions for the panel:
* What was your greatest challenge in maintaining a growth mindset at Turing?
* What were some of the emotions or feelings you experienced when you were at your most challenging point?
* How did those experiences impact your idea of success at Turing?
* Think back to module 1. If you had known then what you know now, what would you change or do differently?
