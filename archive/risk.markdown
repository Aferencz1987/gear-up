# Risk

What happens if it all goes *wrong*?

What happens if it all goes *right*?

## Personal Writing

Let's start with a few minutes of thinking and writing:

### Coming Here Is a Risk

Tuition guarantee or not, there's a huge financial risk in coming to Turing. Beyond that there's a risk to your confidence, your career/life trajectory, maybe even a risk to your personal relationships.

* What does your worst case scenario look like? It all goes wrong, you've spent months here, you're not any good at programming, and you're unemployed. What do you do to get the wheels turning again?
* What would it feel like to be in that position? Surely there'd be disappointment. Would there be any upside? Would you take another swing at programming? Or what other road would you go down?
* How would/will you repair, rebuild, and grow your personal relationships? Who are the people you need to keep close? Who helps you be your best self? Are you risking your relationship with them right now?

### But It Might Go Right

At the moment 95% of graduates are happily employed. That percentage is expected to grow. It might all go right.

* Would would **radical**, almost *unimaginable* success look like? Where would you be? What would you be doing? *Why* does it mean "success" to you? Don't let yourself off the hook with platitudes like "happy" -- what factors will really steer you towards happiness and a feeling of success?
* Who else would benefit (emotionally, financially, or otherwise) from your success? How? Is that a motivating factor for you?
* What's the minimum viable outcome for you, personally? IE the baseline achievement which makes it all just-barely-worthwhile.
* Where does it put you in five years?

### Controlling Risk

The essential divide between a "fixed mindset" and a "growth mindset" is the ownership of change.

* Are you in control of your future? How do you know?
* The core of personal conflict is broken expectations. Do the most important people in your life have appropriate/high expectations for you? Have you discussed your future with them? How, or why not? Who do you most need to have a real conversation with right now?
* Who are your examples of success? Are there any peers or other students/alumni that are doing it right? What's the difference between them and you? Have you ever told them that you think they're doing it right?
* What, under your direct control, are you already doing to mitigate your risk / increase the likelihood of your success? What could you do but are currently *unable/unwilling to do*?

## Group Conversation

We don't have a lot of time today, so please get into group conversation and dive deeply as quickly as possible.

* Discuss at least one prompt from each of the writing sections above
* After thinking, writing, and talking about this issue, **what's the next concrete action you can take to increase your likelihood of success**?
