# Know Your Strengths

After decades of researching personal happiness, workforce development, and management efficacy, Gallup, the research-based, global performance management consulting company, determined that individuals who have an opportunity to focus on their strengths are "six times more likely to be engaged in their jobs" and "three times as likely to report having an excellent quality of life in general." These findings prompted a whole industry of strengths-based professional development tools, foremost of which is Gallup's own StrengthsFinder 2.0, which was Amazon's bestselling book of 2013 and has sold over 9 million copies.”

While there are many frameworks for organizing personal and professional development, this strengths-based approach stands out as a tool. It’s used by companies ranging from Facebook to Rackspace to Google. While other personality tests (ex: Myers-Briggs) have drawn a considerable amount of skepticism, strengths-based approaches are supported by a growing body of research.

>For developing existing teams, there is evidence that “type”-based  personality tests can help managers better develop and deploy the talent they have already hired. For example, Gallup’s StrengthsFinder 2.0 is a tool that helps individuals understand and describe their own talents, and is commonly used by managers to understand and capitalize on the strengths of those they hire. More importantly, it is methodologically sound, and its reliability and validity are backed up by clear evidence.

>Facebook uses StrengthsFinder...Regardless of the job openings they have available, Facebook simply hires the smartest people it can find, then uses StrengthsFinder results to understand their talents and create a job tailored to the candidate.
