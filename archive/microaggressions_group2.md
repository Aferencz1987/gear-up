# Microaggressions

## Mission Alignment
*Our mission is to unlock human potential by training a diverse, inclusive student body to succeed in high-fulfillment technical careers.*

A female M1 Turing student attends a local networking event and is speaking with a company rep. She asks if they are hiring, and he says, "we’re mostly hiring developers, but we have a lot of other roles” and he goes on to list their sales and marketing positions. It's clear to the student that he assumed she didn't have technical skills. Though small and subtle, encounters like this carry an implicit message that women don't belong in tech roles.

While we cannot always protect Turing students from these messages, Turing has a mission-critical responsibility to create a culture in which the messages behind microaggressions are consistently named and challenged. This culture has immediate consequences for students in our program who are more likely to be targets of microaggressions. There are long-term advantages as well; by cultivating student empathy for the effects of these subtle messages, this culture also helps all students practice and develop skills to be more effective advocates for underrepresented groups in tech after they graduate.


## Goal of Session
By the end of this session, students should be able to do the following.
* Define "microaggressions" and identify them when they occur
* Practice empathy for targets of microaggressions
* Identify opportunities in personal conduct to reduce microaggressions and address their consequences

## Write (10 min)
Pick one of Chee's encounters from "A Month of Microaggressions" and reflect on how that episode, in the context of regular similar incidents, would affect you if you were Chee. If helpful, you can use these questions to guide your reflection.

* How would you feel, physically, immediately after this encounter?
* How would you feel, emotionally, immediately after this encounter?
* How do you feel about the person who directed that comment at you?
* How could you build empathy for that person?
* How would you recover from the incident? Assuming the incident was somewhat upsetting, what process would you go through to get back to how you felt beforehand?
* Are there any potential action steps you could take the next time you have an encounter like this? How could you help the commenter understand how to take accountability for their comment?
