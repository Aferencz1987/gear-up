# Turing Citizenship #2: Cohort Vision

## Mission Alignment
*Our mission is to unlock human potential by training a diverse, inclusive student body to succeed in high-fulfillment technical careers.*

Many students describe Turing as one of the most challenging experiences of their lives. On top of new material and a heavy workload, Turing requires you to learn in new ways, get comfortable with the discomfort of not always knowing where to start, and fail repeatedly as part of the frustrating, utterly delightful process of learning.

In order to fulfill Turing's mission, we make concerted effort to help students develop and practice the mindsets we know they'll need to be successful in this setting and the field: growth, engagement, agency, empathy, and grit. Our curriculum and instructional support advance this goal, but that alone is not enough to impart these ways of thinking.

One of the most important features of our community is our culture of mutual support, curiosity, and love of challenge. In their first module at Turing, students will reap the benefits of this culture; this is also when we expect them to begin contributing to it. With a combination of group work, pairings, agile processes, and activities like today's, M1 students are given tools and time to build strong and positive relationships with classmates built on mutual support, encouragement, and accountability.

Over four sessions, students will have an opportunity to connect and organize around the values and goals that brought them to Turing.

  1. **Growth Mindset:** Explore growth mindset and how it will help you succeed at Turing and in the field
  2. **Cohort Vision:** Clarify the values driving your cohort and envision what cohort culture looks, sounds, and feels like
  3. **Public Narrative:** Practice and refine the narratives around which you can build relationships and establish an identity in the field
  4. **Retrospective:** Reflect on what worked and what to build on

Together, these four sessions will help students create a culture of mutual support within their cohort and identify how to tackle challenges with empathy and agility.  


#### Preparation
To prepare for today's cohort vision session, students should read the following three articles.
* []()
* []()
* []()
(Disparities in Tech, cultural norms, empathy)


#### Goals
Today's session will be focused on developing a vision for cohort culture. Students will:

* Reflect what role a mission-driven programming school has in addressing the disparities described in provided articles
* Hear from Jeff and alumni about how Turing's culture relates to its mission
* Identify the qualities of Turing's culture, current cohort culture that are most valued by cohort members
* Articulate vision for cohort culture in pairs and as a group

By the end of the session, students will connect their personal and group norms to Turing's larger community.


## Pair Share (10 min)
In pairs, students will reflect on their readings and their connection to Turing's mission through the following prompts.

* What concerns did the homework articles raise for you? How do the depictions of some tech culture compare to what see as the cultural strengths of the industry?
* What role can a programming school play in addressing some of these concerns? How can we support students while in our program?
* How can Turing demonstrate leadership and equip our students to demonstrate leadership around these issues when they enter the field?


## Panel Discussion (25 min)
Turing leadership, fellow students, and alumni will discuss their perspectives on the role Turing can play in addressing disparities in the field and how Turing's culture advances this work.


## Writing Reflection (5 min)
In notebooks, students will reflect on the ideas that surfaced during the panel discussion.

* Between your direct experiences and ideas from the panel discussion, what qualities of Turing's culture do you most value?
* What values surfaced during the panel discussion? Which are most important to you?
* Write 3-4 sentences to describe your vision for your cohort and your role in it.
  * For inspiration, consider the following questions.
    * When you have your graduation celebration and instructors are sharing what they've appreciated about your cohort, what do they share?
    * If someone walks into your classroom on the evening before your final project is due, what would they see? How does your cohort feel, look, sound to them?
  * Examples
    * _I see us having wildly different, interesting passions and goals, and supporting each other in realizing them_
    * _I see a cohort that is a leader in the school, welcoming new students and helping each other feel safe to make mistakes, garbage fires, and create some beautiful things. People look to me for guidance and advice, and I'm able to respond with poise and confidence even if I don't always know the answer_


## Group Share (8 min)
In groups of 3-4, students share what came up during their writing and the vision statements they developed. Together, groups should clarify the following.

1. _The values_ they'd like to guide their cohort
2. The _individual behavior_ that can advance those values
3. The _group/collaborative work_ that can advance those values (study session, spike sessions, pairings)

Make sure to take notes.


## Report Out (12 min)
As a group, students report out what came from their group conversations.

The cohort's SAB representatives will capture the cohort's ideas on the white board in the three categories discussed within smaller groups.


## Next Steps
SAB members will copy notes from the white board, disseminate to the cohort, and use weekly retros to help the cohort advance its cultural goals.
