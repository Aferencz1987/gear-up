# Debugging the Gender Gap & Microaggressions in Tech

## Introduction (2 min)

Time has passed here at Turing. You've had a larger scale group project and you've gotten to know your cohortmates on a deeper level. We want to start talking about how the tech industry isn't as inclusive as it could be to those who identify with underrepresented groups based on race, gender, sexual orientation, socioeconomic status, age, etc.

We're going to first watch a documentary that addresses some of these inequalities and myths behind why people may believe those from underrepresented groups either aren't "good" at technology or why we don't see more of them in the field. 

We are being explicit but not exclusive about talking about gender in tech given this documentary. After watching the documentary, we'll do an individual reflection and then a small group discussion. We encourage you to take notes if you'd like during this documentary.

## Code: Debugging The Gender Gap (80 minutes)

We'll watch a documentary called _Code: Debugging the Gender Gap_ in the Big Workspace. You can find the trailer [here](http://www.codedoc.co/about/).

## Break (5 min)

## Written Reflection (10 min)

Write about your reaction the movie by reflecting on these questions:

* How are your experiences here at Turing similar or different than those shared in the documentary?
* What role do you play in creating a more inclusive environment in your cohort and the larger community at Turing?
* Brainstorm a specific situation(s) you’ve either witnessed or heard of happening at Turing that might be similar to the stories shared in the movie. What could’ve someone witnessing the instance done differently to positively impact the outcome of situation?

## Small Group Discussion (15 min)

Before diving into small group discussion, we want everyone to keep in mind the following:

* Assume best intent.
* No devil's advocate's. We want to have a meaningful conversation around the screening, not point out edge cases or "what if's".
* Let's practice our Active Listening skills.
* Keep the idea of "intent vs impact" in mind. We often judge ourselves by our intent and others by their impact (partly because we can't read their minds and know their true intent). If you say or do something that makes another person feel a certain way, you are responsible for the impact of your behavior regardless of what your intent was. 

**In your small groups, discuss your reflection to the questions above.**

## Wrap Up (2 min)

**Potential ideas**
* Each group shares key takeaways from small group discussion.
* Individuals will reflect quickly on their main takeaway from their discussion.
* Individuals will reflect and come up with one thing they'd like to share during their cohort retro.
* We'll let students know we're going to talk more about this in their cohort retro.
