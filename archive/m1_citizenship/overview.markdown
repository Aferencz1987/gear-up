# Turing M1 Citizenship Curriculum Overview

*Our mission is to unlock human potential by training a diverse, inclusive student body to succeed in high-fulfillment technical careers.*

Many students describe Turing as one of the most challenging experiences of their lives. On top of new material and a heavy workload, Turing requires you to learn in new ways, get comfortable with the discomfort of not always knowing where to start, and fail repeatedly as part of the frustrating, utterly delightful process of learning.

In order to fulfill Turing's mission, we make concerted effort to help students develop and practice the mindsets we know they'll need to be successful in this setting and the field: growth, engagement, agency, empathy, and grit. Our curriculum and instructional support advance this goal, but that alone is not enough to impart these ways of thinking.

One of the most important features of our community is our culture of mutual support, curiosity, and love of challenge. In their first module at Turing, students will reap the benefits of this culture; this is also when we expect them to begin contributing to it. With a combination of group work, pairings, agile processes, and activities like today's, M1 students are given tools and time to build strong and positive relationships with classmates built on mutual support, encouragement, and accountability.

Over four sessions, students will have an opportunity to connect and organize around the values and goals that brought them to Turing.

  1. **Growth Mindset:** Explore growth mindset and how it will help you succeed at Turing and in the field ([link](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_1_growth_mindset.markdown))
  2. **Cohort Vision:** Clarify the values driving your cohort and envision what cohort culture looks, sounds, and feels like ([link](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_2_cohort_vision.markdown))
  3. **Public Narrative:** Practice and refine the narratives around which you can build relationships and establish an identity in the field ([link](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_3_public_narrative.markdown))
  4. **Retrospective:** Reflect on what worked and what to build on ([link](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_4_retrospective.markdown))

Together, these four sessions will help students create a culture of mutual support within their cohort and identify how to tackle challenges with empathy and agility.
