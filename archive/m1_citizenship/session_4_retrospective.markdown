# Turing Citizenship #4: Retrospective

## Mission Alignment
*Our mission is to unlock human potential by training a diverse, inclusive student body to succeed in high-fulfillment technical careers.*

Many students describe Turing as one of the most challenging experiences of their lives. On top of new material and a heavy workload, Turing requires you to learn in new ways, get comfortable with the discomfort of not always knowing where to start, and fail repeatedly as part of the frustrating, utterly delightful process of learning.

In order to fulfill Turing's mission, we make concerted effort to help students develop and practice the mindsets we know they'll need to be successful in this setting and the field: growth, engagement, agency, empathy, and grit. Our curriculum and instructional support advance this goal, but that alone is not enough to impart these ways of thinking.

One of the most important features of our community is our culture of mutual support, curiosity, and love of challenge. In their first module at Turing, students will reap the benefits of this culture; this is also when we expect them to begin contributing to it. With a combination of group work, pairings, agile processes, and activities like today's, M1 students are given tools and time to build strong and positive relationships with classmates built on mutual support, encouragement, and accountability.

Over four sessions, students will have an opportunity to connect and organize around the values and goals that brought them to Turing.

  1. **Growth Mindset:** Explore growth mindset and how it will help you succeed at Turing and in the field
  2. **Cohort Vision:** Clarify the values driving your cohort and envision what cohort culture looks, sounds, and feels like
  3. **Public Narrative:** Practice and refine the narratives around which you can build relationships and establish an identity in the field
  4. **Retrospective:** Reflect on what worked and what to build on

Together, these four sessions will help students create a culture of mutual support within their cohort and identify how to tackle challenges with empathy and agility.  


#### Goals
Today's session will take an agile approach to reflecting on and developing your cohort culture. Students will:

* Identify what worked well this past module and what should change
* Work in small groups to troubleshoot opportunities to improve
* Reflect on and share gratitudes towards each other

By the end of the session, students will have some clear priorities to focus on as a group moving into next inning. And there will be some celebrating of all the successes from the earlier six weeks.


## Individual Reflection (45 min)


### Personal Reflection (10 min)
In notebooks, students reflect on the individual professional goals they outlined at the beginning of the inning and the personal aspirations that surfaced during their public narrative work.
* Which goals did you meet? Where do you still have more work to do?
* What strategies helped you achieve your goals?
* What role did your cohort play in helping you achieve your goals?


### Fishbowl I: Peer Assessments (15 min)
In groups of 5-6, students reflect on their experiences with the other students in their groups. Students should take notes about each individual's strengths and in what areas they think others could be more effective or impactful. Students should cite examples as much as possible and spend approximately 3 min on each person.


### Fishbowl II: Peer Feedback (20 min)
Focusing on one person in the group at a time, students share what they appreciate about the chosen student and any insight that could help them more effectively advance their personal and professional goals.


## Pomodoro (5 min)


## Group Strengths and Opportunities (55 min)

### +/Δ Individual Reflection (5 min)
| Symbol | How the hell to say it | What it means|
| ---- |----- | ------|
| + | "plus" | worked well |
| Δ | "delta" | should change |

In notebooks, students will reflect on the following questions.
* What helped your cohort collectively achieve its goals?
* What would you like to change next module about your cohort's dynamic?


### +/Δ Pair Reflect (5 min)
Students will discuss individual reflections with a partner.


### +/Δ Report Out (10 min)
Capture all the insight from pair discussions on the whiteboard with a +/Δ chart.


### Vote (5 min)
The facilitator distills topics in the Δ column and holds a vote where students can prioritize topics for further discussion. Each student gets 3 votes, can put all votes on one topic or spread across 3.


### Breakout Groups (25 min)
Students self-select into one of the 4-5 topics deemed most urgent by the group. Each group is responsible for the following:

* Clearly define challenge/opportunity
* Identify strategy for tackling issue
* Clarify next steps and delegate responsibilities

If your topic requires buy-in from those beyond your cohort (instructors, Turing staff), pull in your facilitator to help you strategize around how to effectively advance the cause.


### Report Out (5 min)
Each group will report out to the cohort with their reflections on the three prompts.


## Pomodoro (5 min)


## Letters to Next Inning's M1 (10 min)


## Intro to Next Module (15 min)
