# Turing Citizenship #1: Growth Mindset

## Pre Reading 

"[What Having a Growth Mindset Actually Means](https://hbr.org/2016/01/what-having-a-growth-mindset-actually-means)"

## Mission Alignment

*Our mission is to unlock human potential by training a diverse, inclusive student body to succeed in high-fulfillment technical careers.*

## Learning Goals

Today's session will be focused on developing a vision for cohort culture. Students will:

* Learn what a "growth mindset" is and how it will help them succeed at Turing and in the tech industry
* Identify individual strategies to deal with stresses that trigger a "fixed mindset"
* Identify group strategies for supporting each others' growth mindset

By the end of the session, students will have a clear understanding of the individual choices and behavior that can help them develop/maintain a growth mindset in the midst of Turing's pressures.  

## Intro (5 min)

Faciliators review the Gear Up overview and goals for the session

## What is a Growth Mindset? (15 min)

Together, we will watch growth-mindset expert Carol Dweck's TED Talk, "[The Power of Believing that You Can Improve](https://www.ted.com/talks/carol_dweck_the_power_of_believing_that_you_can_improve)."

## Individual Reflection (5 min)

In your notebook, reflect on the following questions.

* How have your experiences this week put you into a growth or fixed mindset?
* What do you believe can cause a person to get stuck in a fixed mindset?
* What strategies can you use to move into and stay in a growth mindset?
* What supports can you ask for from peers and instructors to support a growth mindset?

## Small Group Discussion (10 min)

In groups of 3, identify a timekeeper, a faciliator, and a notetaker.  Each student should spend about 2 minutes sharing what surfaced during their writing.

Then as a group discuss the prompts below. Take a few notes so you can share later:

* What are some ways you've observed "mindset" at Turing this week?
* What tips have you heard from students, mentors, or alumni about mindset?
* How does the culture of the cohort influence the mindset of the individual?
* What influence do the important people in your life (significant others, family, friends, etc) have on your mindset? Are there negative influences? Positive?

Take notes and assign someone to report out for your group in cohort retro later today.

## Panel Discussion (20 min)

Alumni, instructors, and students will discuss why growth mindset is critical to success at Turing and how growth mindset connects to Turing's mission.

### Sample Questions for The Panel

* What was your greatest challenge in maintaining a growth mindset at Turing?
* What were some of the emotions or feelings you experienced when you were at your most challenging point?
* How did those experiences impact your idea of success at Turing?
* Think back to module 1. If you had known then what you know now, what would you change or do differently?

## Recap at Retro

At your retro this afternoon you'll have an opportunity to discuss as a whole group what you discussed in small groups.

## Survey Questions

Tomorrow in your weekly survey you'll have the opportunity to answer these questions:

* What value would you assign to this session (from 1-5)?
* What are you taking away from this session?
* How do you think this session will change your approach to your time at Turing and in the tech industry?
