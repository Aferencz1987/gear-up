# Managing Stress & Coping Mechanisms


## Growth Mindset Check-In

### Reflection (5 min)

* When have you been challenged by growth mindset in the last week?
* In what ways has growth mindset helped you this week?
* What do you need to be even more successful with growth mindset?

### Small Group Discussion (5 min)

Share with a group of three your responses to the reflection questions.

## Reflection - Stress Management (5 min)

You have balanced stress in the past. Given that we're all in a unique situation with this immersive environment, we want to take a deep look at how well you've been able to manage that stress. First, we want to reflect on what you've done in the past.

* In the past, what has gone well for you when dealing with stressful situations?
* In the past, what has not gone so well when dealing with stressful situations?

## [Common] Ways to Respond to Stress (10 min)

There are four common ways to respond to stress: attack others, attack self, avoidance, and withdrawal. If we think of these responses on a coordinate plane (draw on board), the edges of the axis are when we've hit our maximum. 

Throw out these questions to the group and write examples on board:
* What are some examples of attack others?
* What are some examples of attacking self?
* What are some examples of avoidance?
* What are some examples of withdrawal?

These are the extremes. We use "off-ramps" to help manage our stress before we get to these extremes. If we're on the verge of attacking self or avoidance, what are some things we could do before we hit that point? 

The more we actively practice these "off-ramps", the stronger the neurological connections in our brain become and it makes it easier for us to respond with these "off-ramps" rather than hitting the extreme.

## Small Group Discussion (15 min)

* What's your most common response to stress (using the framework above or not)?
* What are some common "off-ramps" that you find helpful?

Small groups will list their "off-ramps" on a piece of chart paper and brainstorm "off-ramps" they'd like to try. 

## Action Planning (10 min)

Students will take a lap around the room to see examples of other positive "off-ramps." Students will create an action plan to respond to stressful situations that might arise for the last half of the module. 

## Cohort Retro Share Out

In retro today, you'll get with a small group of others to share your action plan.

## Survey Questions

* What value would you assign to this session (from 1-5)?
* What's your most important take away from this session?
