# Personal Stories & Connection

### (5 minutes) Framing: Why are you here, connection, telling your story

A long, long time from now, when you are ready to graduate, you will give a lightning talk about your experiences at Turing.  Today we are going to start that lightning talk by sharing more about what brought you here and what you hope to accomplish.  This is the start of you being able to tell your story professionally and find the right match for your future career.  

### (10 minutes) Individual Reflection

Students will write in their notebooks and reflect on the following questions:
* What brought you here?  
* What lenses or identities do you view the world through most often?
* What are the values that drive you?
* How do you think you demonstrate those values to people around you?
* Could other people identify your values from your actions/words/presence? Why or why not?

### (20 minutes) Small Group Share

Students will get into groups of four and discuss key takeaways from their individual reflection. Each group member should get 3 minutes to talk (uninterupted about the first two reflection questions). Assign someone to keep time.  You will have additional time in your group after everyone shares.  With that additional time, discuss your ideas for this final question:
* How can we operate as a cohort to build on our similarities and learn from our differences?

### (10 minutes) Whole Group Share

Each groups's presenter shares their groups discussion of "How do you think these differences/similarites will impact your cohort?" 


### (10 minutes) Prepare your slides

Prepare the slides that you will use for your final lightning talk.  In your notebooks, think about how you would design slides and what you would want to be on the slides.  There are three slides you should focus on at this time:

* Where are you from?
* What brought you to Turing?
* What do you hope to accomplish during your time here?

### (5 minutes) Closing

On graduation day, cohorts have the opportunity to share their reflections on their time here.  Over and over again, cohorts comment that they wish they had shared more of their stories sooner.  Cohorts comment that they wish they had spent more time understanding each other and what experiences brought each person here.  Consider ways that you can share your stories, the things that you value, and what you are hoping for in the upcoming weeks.  The more connections you can make, the better you will be able to work together towards success.
