# Turing Citizenship #3: Public Narrative

## Mission Alignment
*Our mission is to unlock human potential by training a diverse, inclusive student body to succeed in high-fulfillment technical careers.*

Many students describe Turing as one of the most challenging experiences of their lives. On top of new material and a heavy workload, Turing requires you to learn in new ways, get comfortable with the discomfort of not always knowing where to start, and fail repeatedly as part of the frustrating, utterly delightful process of learning.

In order to fulfill Turing's mission, we make concerted effort to help students develop and practice the mindsets we know they'll need to be successful in this setting and the field: growth, engagement, agency, empathy, and grit. Our curriculum and instructional support advance this goal, but that alone is not enough to impart these ways of thinking.

One of the most important features of our community is our culture of mutual support, curiosity, and love of challenge. In their first module at Turing, students will reap the benefits of this culture; this is also when we expect them to begin contributing to it. With a combination of group work, pairings, agile processes, and activities like today's, M1 students are given tools and time to build strong and positive relationships with classmates built on mutual support, encouragement, and accountability.

Over four sessions, students will have an opportunity to connect and organize around the values and goals that brought them to Turing.

  1. **Growth Mindset:** Explore growth mindset and how it will help you succeed at Turing and in the field
  2. **Cohort Vision:** Clarify the values driving your cohort and envision what cohort culture looks, sounds, and feels like
  3. **Public Narrative:** Practice and refine the narratives around which you can build relationships and establish an identity in the field
  4. **Retrospective:** Reflect on what worked and what to build on

Together, these four sessions will help students create a culture of mutual support within their cohort and identify how to tackle challenges with empathy and agility.  


#### Goals
Today's session will help students refine their public narratives and practice sharing them to build strong, positive professional relationships. Students will:

* Articulate their public narrative: what led to the decision to come and what meaning does it hold?
* Set intentions around how to face Turing's challenges
* Share their stories in a way that helps build positive relationships with peers

Public narrative is an important tool for building relationships at Turing and will also help students understand how to present themselves in the industry and with potential employers.

## Introduction (5 min)
Jeff will kick off today's session on public narratives and why we work with Turing students to develop theirs.


## Panel Discussion (20 min)
Students will hear from employers, Turing employment coordinators, instructors and fellow students about the role stories and personal narratives play in building strong, positive professional relationships and securing opportunities that will meet your needs and interests.


## Break (5 min)
Pomodoros aren't just for coding.


## Develop Personal Stories (25 min)
We will begin this session with 5 minutes of individual reflection using this [worksheet](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/handouts/personal_worksheet.pdf).

For the second part of the session, students will work in groups of 4 to share their personal stories and receive feedback on how to more effectively communicate their experiences. Each person will share for 2 minutes, then the group will take 2 min to give feedback. Use this [worksheet](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/handouts/reflections_worksheet.pdf)) to organize feedback.


## Break (5 min)
Ditto.


## Sharing of Public Narratives (90 min)
Join with instructors, staff, and classmates to learn more about each other and soak in the common goals you share.
