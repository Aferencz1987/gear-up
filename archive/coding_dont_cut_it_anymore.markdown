## Reading

** The following excerpt comes from "Tip 3" of [Chad Fowler's *The Passionate Programmer*](https://pragprog.com/book/cfcar2/the-passionate-programmer) **

It’s not enough to think about what technologies you’re going to invest in. After all, the technology part is a commodity, right? You’re not going to be able to sit back and simply master a programming language or an operating system, letting the businesspeople take care of the business stuff. If all they needed was a code robot, it would be easy to hire someone in another country to do that kind of work. If you want to stay relevant, you’re going to have to dive into the domain of the business you’re in.

In fact, a software person should understand a business domain not only well enough to develop software for it but also to become one of its authorities. At a previous company, I saw an excellent example of this. The database administration team consisted of people who really weren’t interested in database technology. When I was first exposed to them, it was a bit of a shock. Why are these people in information technology? I wondered. In terms of technical skill, they just weren’t very strong. But, this team had something special. Being the keepers and protectors of our enterprise data, they actually knew the business domain better than almost any business analyst we had. Their knowledge and understanding of the business made them hot commodities in the internal job posting market. While us geeks were looking at them disdainfully, the business for which they worked recognized a ton of value in them.

You should think of your business domain experience as an important part of your repertoire. If you’re a musician, when you add something to your repertoire, it doesn’t just mean you’ve played the song once. It means you truly know the song. You should apply the same theory to your business domain experience. For example, having worked on a project in the health insurance industry doesn’t guarantee that you understand the difference between an HIPAA 835 and an HIPAA 837 EDI transaction. It’s this kind of knowledge that differentiates two otherwise equivalent software developers in the right situation.

You might be “just a programmer,” but being able to speak to your business clients in the language of their business domain is a critical skill. Imagine how much easier life would be if everyone you had to work with really understood how software development works. You wouldn’t have to explain to them why it’s a bad idea to return 30,000 records in a single page on a web application or why they shouldn’t pass out links to your development server. This is how your business clients feel about you: Imagine how much easier it would be to work with these programmers if they just understood what I was asking them for without me having to dumb everything down and be so ridiculously specific! And, guess what? It’s the business that pays your salary.

Just like technologies that become hot, business domains can be selected in the same way. Java and .NET are the Big Things right now in software development. If you learn them, you can compete for a job in one of the many companies that will employ these technologies. The same is true of business domains. You should put the same level of care into selecting which industry to serve as you put into selecting which technologies to master.

In light of the importance that you should place on selecting a business domain when rounding out your portfolio, the company and industry you choose to work for becomes a significant investment on your part. If you haven’t yet given real, intentional thought to which business domains you should be investing in, now is the time. Each passing day is a missed opportunity. Like leaving your savings in a low-yield savings account when higher interest rates are to be had, leaving your development on the business front in stasis is a bad investment choice.

## Exercises

Write a paragraph or more for each of the following questions:

1. What are you already unusually knowledgeable about? Where does that knowledge come from? How can you leverage that knowledge in the job hunt / job interviews / job itself?
2. What other subject domains are you interested in? How could you develop your knowledge/value in the domain during your remaining time at Turing?
3. The Ruby world continues to grow, but not at the exponential rate it did a few years ago. What other technical expertise will you develop to augment your skills?

## Discussion

Get together with your small group and discuss the following:

1. How can your fellow students, across cohorts, enhance your domain knowledge?
2. Are there any technologies you're interested in learning because of a specific domain you're interested in? How can you make that happen?
3. Do you think programming skills will be truly commoditized? What would/will that mean for your career?
