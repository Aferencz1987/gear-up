# Learning and Spaced Repetition

What strategies do you use to learn? Do you have a strategy? "Just do it"? Wish real hard?

Today let's read/think/talk about learning strategies.

## Abstract and Concrete

Sometimes you need to learn abstract ideas and sometimes you just need to memorize the cold-hard-facts. The crux of programming
is all about abstract ideas, but there are still a lot of facts -- the kernels of knowledge that you need to actually put
the abstract ideas into practice.

How do you learn those facts? How do you study them? How do you know which ones you do and don't know? How do you find
out what you don't know when you don't know it exists?

## Spaced Repetition

You've probably used flashcards at some point in the past. But that still wasn't a strategy. Read these two short articles:

* Quick version: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition
* Deeper version with graphs: http://www.gwern.net/Spaced%20repetition

Sound cool? Obvious? Obvious now that you've read it?

## Collaborate

Talk with your small group about the Spaced Repetition concept.

* Do you have any concrete strategies that you use already?
* Are your strategies effective?

## Gathering Data

Either collaboratively or on your own work on and discuss the following:

What did you learn this week? Stop and think about it for a few minutes:

* Brainstorm the "big topics" you were working on this week
* For each of those can you come up with 10 essential facts that you want to remember? Maybe it's what happens to Ruby
symbols when they're serialized to JSON. Maybe it's how to build a Hash with `inject`. Look for small ideas that can be
summed up in a sentence or a few words.
* Do you know what you don't know? Can you remember the things which you didn't understand? How can peers help with this problem?
* Could we build these up into an archive that could be iterated upon and grow over time?

## Contribute?

It'd be cool to spin up `https://github.com/turingschool/facts` and collect a bunch of ideas, facts, etc. Are you up for running the
project? Post a comment here: https://github.com/turingschool/facts/issues/1
