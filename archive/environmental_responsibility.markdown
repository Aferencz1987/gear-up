# Environmental Responsibility

Today, we will try a new model for our exploration:

* Part 1: Small groups explore a single topic (reading, writing, discussing)
* Part 2: Jigsaw groups discuss across topics
* Part 3: Community debrief

We will be exploring perspectives on **environmental responsibility**.

## Part 1: Small Groups, Single Topic

### Reading (~10 Minutes)

On the outline your group was assigned one of the domains below. Read the appropriate articles.

#### 1. Apathy

* [The psychology of climate change: why we do nothing](http://www.theecologist.org/News/news_analysis/301036/the_psychology_of_climate_change_why_we_do_nothing.html)
* [Your brain on climate change: why the threat produces apathy, not action](http://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2014/nov/10/brain-climate-change-science-psychology-environment-elections)

#### 2. Policy & Systematic Change

* [Leonardo Dicaprio's 2016 Oscar Acceptance Speech](http://oscar.go.com/news/winners/watch-leonardo-dicaprios-acceptance-speech-for-best-actor-2016) - from 2:00 on
* [The Climate Connection: "Nudge" theory](http://www.bbc.co.uk/worldservice/science/2010/11/101129_climate_connection_nudge_theory_video.shtml)
* [Why David Cameron's 'nudge unit' is a waste of time for the environment](http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/mar/31/david-cameron-nudge-unit-environment)

#### 3. Resources as Fuel for Industrialization & Growth

* [Smells Like Progress: Growing Up in Cancer Alley](https://blog.epa.gov/blog/2013/08/smells-like-progress/)
* [What Is Equity in the Context of Climate Negotiations?](http://www.wri.org/blog/2012/12/what-equity-context-climate-negotiations)

#### 4. Morality & Religion

* [Pope Francis, in Sweeping Encyclical, Calls for Swift Action on Climate Change](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/19/world/europe/pope-francis-in-sweeping-encyclical-calls-for-swift-action-on-climate-change.html?_r=0)
* [Stewards of the Earth](http://www.emagazine.com/magazine-archive/stewards-of-the-earth) - Starting from the heading "Active for Islam" towards the end
* [Christianity and Climate Activism](http://yearsoflivingdangerously.com/video/reaching-across-divide/)

#### 5. Radical Environmentalism

* [Excerpt from Derrick Jensen's Endgame](http://www.derrickjensen.org/work/endgame/endgame-premises-english/)

### Writing (~5 Minutes)

Consider the following questions and write about them in your notebook:

* What do you think were the strongest arguments in these pieces?
* What reinforced ideas you already had?
* What considerations were overlooked?
* Were there any details that surprised you? If so, what?
* How do the authors' position affect your sense of individual responsibility around this topic?
* How could it affect the Turing community's responsibility?

### Discussion (~10 Minutes)

Based on what group you're in, discuss the following questions:

#### 1. Apathy

* What do you think are the greatest barriers to taking action for a cause?
* Do you think these are legitimate reasons? Why or why not?
* When is a time when you felt frustrated by another person's apathy? What could you do to engage a person who is apathetic?

#### 2. Policy & Systematic Change

* Is working for policy change a meaningful way to address environmental issues?
* What are obstacles to creating policy change? What can we do about it?
* If policy change is not a meaningful way to address these issues, what is?

#### 3. Resources as Fuel for Industrialization & Growth

* Is there an inherent trade-off between economic growth and environmental degradation?
* Is the inequity that has resulted from market-driven development acceptable? Why or why not?
* If those inequities are unacceptable, what could be done to address them?

#### 4. Morality & Religion

* Is there a moral, religious, or spiritual reason to be environmentally responsible?
* Do you think there is a place for moral, religious, or spiritual thought to guide environmental policy?
* How can we engage in a productive conversation with people who have different perspectives from us?

#### 5. Radical Environmentalism

* What are your initial reactions to this piece?
* What premise(s) particularly strike you? Why? Do you agree with it? Why or why not?
* Is industrial civilization inherently unsustainable? Is there value in working towards a sustainable society?

## Part 2: Jigsaw Discussion (~20 Minutes)

Now rotate into your second group and let's discuss across topics with a representative from each topic group.

First, whip around the group giving a short summary of your topic and small group discussion. Second, consider the following questions:

* What approach would you like to see Turing take toward this issue of environmental responsibility? Has that changed after being exposed to new perspectives? Why?
* If Turing could impart one skill on graduates that would help them bring a more environmentally responsible culture to their future employers, what should that skill be?
* What role do businesses and tech companies play in environmental responsibility?

## Async Debrief (~5 Minutes)

Take the last few minutes of our time, jump in #Turing on Slack, and have one member of your jigsaw group members share your key takeaways.
