## Small Group Discussion

Discuss each of the following in your small group but be sure to *spend at least three minutes* on number 5.

1. Why aren't there more women in tech? What are some naive/stereotypical answers that people might think up?
What are some of the more complex problems?
2. What's the gender (im)balance like at Turing? How do you think that compares to the larger tech industry?
3. What are some of the soft ways that gender plays into our conversations about programming? What about our conversations
at large? What about in our recreation (happy hour, etc)?
4. If you felt uncomfortable in an interaction with another student, what would you do? What if you were an observer?
What if a student shared a story with you in confidence/secret?
5. What are some of the *concrete* things we can do to create a supportive, welcoming environment? Push for things you/we
can actively *do*, not just things to *avoid doing*.

Put one of your group's most interesting ideas for each question on a post-it and add it to the whiteboard.

## Share Out

We'll spend the last few minutes discussing the issues and ideas all together.
