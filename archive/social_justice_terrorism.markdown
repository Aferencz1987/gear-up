# Social Justice Terrorism

The goals of Gear Up are to provoke conversation and help us find/develop the touch points of our group culture.

Provoking conversation isn't always a kumbaya situation. People can feel validated or they can feel attacked. New perspectives can open or old ones can harden.

Homogenous cultures are easy because people have shared experiences, similar perspectives, and can smooth out their small conflict. Diverse culture are tumultuous, incubating creativity, but also turbulent.

## Reading (~6 Minutes)

In that turbulence some people get hurt. For one perspective on our work, read the attached essay, Social Justice Terrorism, written by a former Turing student. You can [find it online here](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/social-justice-terrorism-drew-conly). Then dive into the writing below.

## Writing (~15 Minutes)

Let's spend about 15 minutes writing on these topics:

* What do you most agree with in the essay?
* When the topic of diversity is discussed, do you feel included? Uplifted? Brow-beaten? How can we discuss important topics like this without people feeling alienated?
* There are many assertions about gender and gender equity in the piece. Obviously, by the numbers, Turing is gender-inequal. Do you notice that on a frequent basis? Do you think it has an impact on our culture? How?
* When, at Turing or in life, do you feel the most unwelcome because of your identity?
* Victimhood is a deep rut to fall into. What do you do when you feel yourself slipping into that thinking? What/who pulls you out?
* Do you feel like these Gear Up sessions are valuable to you? Do you look forward to them, dread them, or just feel indifferent?
* What's something you've learned in one of these sessions?
* How do you build/promote the community you want to exist here at Turing? What small things do you do and when/how do you do them? What stops you from doing more? (*hint*: don't let yourself off the hook with "time")

## Discuss (~18 Minutes)

When the group wraps up writing then transition to a group conversation. Use the above questions as starting points, but along the way mix in / look for:

* Where are the most stark differences in perspective? Why?
* What was the *most recent* (not the most significant) time you felt unwelcome/undervalued? Look for the differences in the group's answers as an indicator on our silent privilege.
* What can we, as a group, do better?
