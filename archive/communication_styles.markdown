## Communication Styles

### Introduction to Exercise (5 min)
“I'm a great believer that any tool that enhances communication has profound effects in terms of how people can learn from each other, and how they can achieve the kind of freedoms that they're interested in.” - Bill Gates  

“The spoken word belongs half to him who speaks, and half to him who listens.” - French Proverb  

### Read and Write (25 min)
Read "[Which Of These 4 Communication Styles Are You?](http://www.forbes.com/sites/markmurphy/2015/08/06/which-of-these-4-communication-styles-are-you/#193989a51ecb)" (Mark Murphy, *Forbes*: August 6, 2015) and reflect on the following questions in writing in your notebooks.
* Which communication style (Analytical, Intuitive, Functional and Personal) do you think is your dominant style?  
  **(When you answer this question, please log your answer in the #on-campus channel in Slack. We will use this info to divide into groups)**
* In what settings do you think this style is most effective? Reflect on a specific occasion when this style helped you be effective (build relationships, advance a cause you cared about, sell an idea).
* Reflect on the other three communication styles. How would you characterize your reactions to people with these other styles? Does your reaction change depending on the context (a casual outing with friends versus a high-pressure project with colleagues)?
* Does Murphy's article leave out other communication factors that are meaningful to you? What other lenses could you use to distinguish between individuals' communication styles?

### Discussion (25 min)
Organize into the groups posted on [today.turing.io](today.turing.io) and introduce yourselves (5 min). Appoint someone to be timekeeper.  

Discuss the following topics within your groups.
* Have the members of your group report out their style. When have their styles helped and created challenges for them?
* How is each person's style perceived by those with other styles?
* What issues came up in the "Does Murphy's article leave out other communication factors...?" question during your writing exercise?
* What adjustments do you think you can make to communicate with others more effectively?
* Have each individual recall their most challenging project at Turing in terms of team dynamics. Did communication styles factor into your dynamic? If so, how?
