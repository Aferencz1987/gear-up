## Readings

Today we're going to talk about crucial conversations. The following information has been extracted for you from a longer whitepaper about Crucial Conversations -- the conversations we have when someone has broken our expectations.

### Big Picture

* A study of 25,000 top influencers across sectors found that titles, technical skills or even charisma yielded less influence than stepping up to colleagues, coworkers or even bosses, and holding them accountable.
* Interpersonal challenges in the workplace are rarely fixed by new policies, rules, or a third party.
* Solutions come from compassionate confrontation -- talking plainly, deliberately, and directly about the issues at hand with the persons involved.

### Approaching a Crucial Conversation

How do you prepare for a Crucial Conversation? Think through this "CPR" framework:

#### Content

The first time a problem comes up, talk about the CONTENT, what just happened. The content typically deals with a single event.

#### Pattern

The next time the problem occurs, talk about the PATTERN, what has been happening over time. Pattern issues acknowledge that frequent and continued violations affect the other person’s predictability and eventually harm trust and respect in the classroom.

#### Relationship

As the problem continues, talk about RELATIONSHIP, what’s happening to us. The issue is not that the other person has repeatedly disappointed you or the class; it’s that the string of disappointments has caused you to lose trust in that person.

### Consequences

When those actions take place they have consequences. You need to discuss those directly. A person’s behavior is usually not the problem; it’s what happens afterwards — the consequences. When you want to clarify the issue you need to confront, ask yourself the following questions:

* What are the consequences of this problem to me?
* What are the consequences to our relationship?
* What are the consequences to the task?
* What are the consequences to other stakeholders?

### Intent and Behavior

When we observe notable behaviors we naturally make assumptions about intentions. We draw conclusions about others’ intentions with very limited information, sometimes correctly, sometimes incorrectly. When this happens, we need to separate intent from the behavior and treat this underlying intention as the main issue.

### Corrective Goal

When you are confronted with a host of different problems, ask yourself what you want for yourself, for the other person, for the relationship, for the class. If you don’t think about all three of these aspects, one will be pushed aside and you won’t solve your most important problem.

### Let It Go?

How do you know if you should speak up? Ask yourself these questions. If your answer to three or more are "yes," then it’s time to act.

* Am I acting based on my real concerns?
* Is my conscience nagging me? Will I regret not having said anything?
* Am I safe enough to take the risk of speaking up?
* Do I believe that I can make a difference?

### Taking Action

You decide that it's time for action. Now what?

#### 1. Set the Standard

Once you’ve decided to confront a problem, you have to work on yourself before you say anything. The tone of a confrontation is set the moment we assume the other person is guilty and we begin feeling angry and morally superior. We see what the other person did and then tell ourselves a story about why he or she did it, which leads to a feeling, which leads to our actions. We quickly jump to conclusions and assume that people do what they do because of personality factors (their disposition) alone, as opposed to doing what they do because of forces in their environment (the situation). Psychologists call this the Fundamental Attribution Error, and people are more likely to make this error under adverse conditions.

#### 2. Solutions & Correctness

Your goal is to solve a problem. Not be right. Be sure to end your opening conversations with someone with a sincere invitation for the other person to share even contrary opinions with you.

#### 3. Addressing the Issue

Consider this process:

* Share your path. What details should you talk about? What part of the path should you share: the original action or behavior, the result, your conclusion, or your feeling?
* Replay the facts. People are likely to become defensive if you start with your stories. Instead, describe what the person did.
* Explain the results. By talking about the result, you let the person know why you’ve brought up the issue. You’ve framed the problem.
* End with a question. After describing your failed expectation, your goal should be to hear the other person’s point of view. You let the other person know this is a dialogue, not a monologue. Leave the door open for discussion

People let us down either because they aren’t motivated to do what we ask or they aren’t able (because they lack either the necessary skills or knowledge).

## Individual Work

Spend the rest of the individual time writing answers to the following questions:

1. What are your strengths in confronting others?
2. What are your challenges?
3. What scares you the most about crucial conversations?
4. Think of a time you felt successful in a crucial conversation – what did this look like? Feel like? What happened?
5. What was the last time you regretted *not* having a conversation / addressing an issue? Why didn't you do it at the time?

## Small Group Conversation

Your group should have a few small slips of paper that are the lines for three separate role plays. For *EACH* of the
three scenarios:

1. Have one person be "Person A" and a second one "Person B". Alternate lines starting with Person A.
2. When you finish the script, as a group work through the process described in the reading above. How would you approach the crucial conversation?
3. Share any additional thoughts or ask questions of the group
