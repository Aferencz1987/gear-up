# Empathy & Privilege

## Overview

## Background/Introduction (5 minutes)

Privilege refers to the advantages that individuals and groups are afforded in systems of power (communities, organizations, countries, families, etc.). Often, conversations about privilege become ones where stark lines are drawn between "haves" and "have-nots"; we're aiming for a slightly different discussion today, where we'll focus on how privilege and marginalization affect our relationships with each other and how we can navigate these dynamics to work better together.

In previous session's we've spoken about our strengths, and our implicit biases. This session, we're going to discuss how privilege works in our lives, and how we can use our experiences with privilege when we interact with students and each other.

How do we interact as a staff? How do we interact with students where we automatically have some degree of power? How can we use our previous experiences to better connect to one another and our students?

### Goals:

If this is a new concept to you or haven't had much opportunity to think about its role in your life:

* Introduce you to the idea of privilege and give space to start thinking about how it impacts your life and the lives of those around you.

If you've reflected on this before:

* Provide an opportunity to think about how privilege plays out here at Turing specifically with staff and students and how we can use our previous experiences with privilege to make Turing an inclusive community.

### Norms

* Share the air:  Be aware of your talk time
* Seek to understand:  Ask questions instead of assuming
* Listen fully:  Not just waiting for your turn to talk
* Confidential:  Your group conversation is only for your group. Share your thoughts and feelings, not stories of others.
* Be comfortable with discomfort: We learn the most when we allow ourselves to be out of our comfort zone

## Warmup: Review Statements (5 minutes)

Review the following list of statements that describe the different ways people in our society may experience privilege or marginalization. Put a check mark next to statements that are true for you.

## Reflect (5 minutes)

### Self-Reflection

* Select one of the statements that you did not check that you would feel comfortable discussing.
    * When is your experience of not having this particular advantage most pronounced?
    * When are you most comfortable with this aspect of your life?
    * If you were trying to describe that experience to someone else, what would that person need to do to help you continue to feel connected/trusting of them, even if they didn't share the experience?
* Select one of the statements that you did check that you would feel comfortable discussing: when are you most aware of this advantage? What has it given you?
* What statement made you think most? If you could add a statement, what would it be?

### Potential Turing Facing Actions

* How do you use your life experiences when interacting with students/potential students?
* Are there things that you can do welcome students with similar/dissimilar experiences to your own?
* Are there things we could do as a staff?

## Discuss (20 minutes)

Before you begin, select someone in your group to take notes and share out.

Use 10 minutes to discuss and share your answers to the self-reflection questions above, and 10 minutes to share answers to the potential Turing facing actions.

## Share (10 minutes)

Start a thread in Slack channel to document Turing facing actions.

## Prep

* Print statements
* Organize groups
