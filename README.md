# Gear Up

## Overview
Turing's mission is to unlock human potential by training a diverse, inclusive student body to succeed in high-fulfillment technical careers. Our vision is a world powered by technology where the people building it represent the people using it. We're here to build a movement.

In order to advance this mission and vision, our curriculum transcends technical training. We also present students with opportunities to grow as individuals, members of a team, and members of a community. 

Gear Up is an intentional and continuously integrated part of the Turing curriculum to instill the purpose of our mission and aid the student body in building a diverse and inclusive community.

* Curriculum spans 4 modules
* Each module includes 3 Gear Up sessions
* Knowledge: Gear Ups provide students with knowledge about intersections of identity and institutionalized systems of power, along with data and vocabulary connecting those topics to tech specifically.
* Understanding: Students will be asked to engage in critical self-reflection in order to be able to identify their individual powers and privileges and how their actions can impact the larger community.
* Skills: Students will gain the skill set to: 
  - Navigate critical conversations 
  - Approach their community with empathy and vulnerability 
  - Practice humility as they enter the tech industry
