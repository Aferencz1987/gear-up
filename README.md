# Gear Up

## Overview
Turing's mission is to unlock human potential by training a diverse, inclusive student body to succeed in high-fulfillment technical careers. Our vision is a world powered by technology where the people building it represent the people using it. We're here to build a movement.

In order to advance this mission and vision, our curriculum transcends technical training. We also present students with opportunities to grow as individuals, members of a team, and members of a community. 

Gear Up provides a forum for students to develop self-awareness, interpersonal skills, and gain awareness of the issues preventing tech from being an inclusive space. 

* Curriculum spans 4 modules
* Each module includes 3 Gear Up sessions
* Sessions are targeted at developing personal awareness in Mod 1.  Mod 2 and 3 are focused on the interpersonal relationships and how to navigate personal privlege and power. Mod 4 provides students the opportunity to create sessions on issues that they personally care about.  Mod 4 students brainstorm, create, and facilitate gear ups for the entire school community.
