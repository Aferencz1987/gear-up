### Turing Culture: Developing Empathetic Programmers

_Our **mission** is to unlock human potential by training a diverse, inclusive student body to succeed in high-fulfillment technical careers._

### Why Empathy?
* Interpersonal skills (including empathy) have a direct, significant impact on your professional success.
* Empathy is a foundational interpersonal skill. Other skills, such as collaboration, communication, compromise all hinge on your ability to demonstrate empathy.
* Interpersonal skills, including empathy, can be developed and improved.
* Turing's mission (cited above) demands that we support students development of technical _and_ interpersonal skills. 

### Pre-Work Preparation
#### Read
Read _two_ of the following articles/videos (we recommend all of them!) and reflect on these questions: why are we talking about empathy at a software development school? how can you develop the "skill" of empathy? and why should you care?

* ["Why is Empathy Important for Design"](http://www.bresslergroup.com/blog/why-empathic-design/)
* ["The Surprising (Nontechnical) Skill You Need to Succeed in Tech"](https://www.themuse.com/advice/the-surprising-and-nontechnical-skill-you-need-to-succeed-in-tech), _The Muse_
* ["Why Aren't We More Compassionate?"](http://www.ted.com/talks/daniel_goleman_on_compassion#t-39146), TED Talk (Daniel Goleman)
* ["Can you teach people to have empathy?"](http://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-33287727), BBC (Jun 29, 2015)


#### Reflect
After reading the articles above, create a gist on Github and reflect (4-6 sentences) on the following prompts.
* What role does empathy play in your life and how has it helped you?
_Empathy plays a huge part in my life. It is a constant moral compass calibrator for me. I lean on how I think my actions impact others and how I think my actions might be interpreted by a variety of folks when thinking about choices I make. If not for empathy I would not be able to move past sympathy and really imagine how I might feel with all of external factors and value differences. It is my guidebook for a more inclusive authentic life._
* How does empathy help you build better software?
_Empathy helps you build better software because it takes into consideration our own individual experience builds that work great for me might be absolute crap for others. It pushes people to make better choices. For example, my i phone is racist. It cant tell the difference between two brown babies that look nothing alike other than their skin tone. My i phone can tell the difference between the white babies though. If they had more folks of color desinging that feature, they would now how shitty it feels when a simple face recognition program cant tell the difference. Also, while it wouldnt be that offensive to a white person and therefore not a high priority, a person of color, might be reminded of sterotypes that all ______ folks look the same. It's f*cked._
* Why is empathy important for working on a team?
_Empathy is important for working with team members because it reminds you to be considerate. It reminds you that there will be times when people make mistakes and having grace with them when that happens is important. Understanding what outside factors might be going on and how that might impact them is key to having a compassionate work flow. Better morale, better work._
* Describe a situation in which your ability to empathize with a colleague or teammate was helpful.
_I am not a mother. Being able to recognize when the colleague who was a mother needed a break or understanding that work is her safe space from the rigor of motherhood had saved a lot of stress for both of us before. Understanding why they're absentminded from a rough night of no sleep and not being upset with them keeps morale up._
* When do you find it most difficult to be empathetic in professional settings? How can you improve your skills when faced with these scenarios?
_I find it most hard to be empathetic when a boss in unempathic with me. Power dynamics that disallow for contrustructive conversation and undue stress suck. The skills needed to improve my reactions when faced with these scenarios are to imagine why they became that way. It is something that is hard and I work on it._
