## Background/Introduction (5 minutes)

In previous session's we've spoken about our strengths, and our implicit biases. This session, we're going to discuss how privilege works in our lives, and how we can use our experiences with privilege when we interact with students and each other.

If this is your first time discussing privilege, or if you haven't had much opportunity to think about it's role in your life, then the goal of this session is to introduce you to the idea of privilege so that you can start thinking about how it 



*EM*
I think adding some framing about why we want to have this session...as staff we experience privilege in different ways. As we think about bias and the lenses we carry, we also want to consider places where we have privilege so that we can become better allies in those spaces.





Talked about our strengths
Talked about implicit bias

Want to talk about power/privilege because our strengths and biases are connected to how we experience privilege.

How do we interact as a staff. How do we interact with students where we automatically have power.

In order to become a better ally to people who do not share that privilege or who have experienced a similar lack of privilege.


All of us have thought about 


Goals:

If you've never thought about this before:

* 

If you've reflected on this before:

* creating space by being more vulnerable.


Privilege refers to the advantages that individuals and groups are afforded in systems of power (communities, organizations, countries, families, etc.). Often, conversations about privilege become ones where stark lines are drawn between "haves" and "have-nots"; we're aiming for a slightly different discussion today, where we'll focus on how privilege and marginalization affect our relationships with each other and how we can navigate these dynamics to work better together.

### Norms

* Share the air:  Be aware of your talk time
* Seek to understand:  Ask questions instead of assuming
* Listen fully:  Not just waiting for your turn to talk
* Confidential:  Your group conversation is only for your group. Share your thoughts and feelings, not stories of others.
* Be comfortable with discomfort: We learn the most when we allow ourselves to be out of our comfort zone

## Warmup: Review Statements (5 minutes)

Review the following list of statements that describe the different ways people in our society may experience privilege or marginalization. Put a check mark next to statements that are true for you.

* Generally people do not make assumptions about you based on how you look.
* You come from a two-parent household.
* You can make mistakes and not have people attribute your behavior to flaws in your racial or gender group.
* You have always assumed you would go to college.
* You do not have an invisible illness or disability.
* You have not been a victim of sexual harassment/assault.
* You do not rely, or have not relied, primarily on public transportation.
* You studied the culture of your ancestors in elementary school.
* You are frequently familiar with the cultural references (music, TV, film, literature) that people make in social gatherings.
* You celebrate the same holidays as most of your friends and acquaintances.
* Characters in the movies/tv you watch frequently have life experiences/backgrounds similar to your own.
* You often feel/felt that your parents do/did have time to spend with you.
* You would never think twice about calling the police when trouble occurs.
* English is your first language.
* There was never substance abuse in your household.
* You do not feel uncomfortable sharing your political attitudes because they would be held against you.
* You don't have to consider your safety when walking or communiting home at night.
* No one in your household suffered or suffers from mental illness.

* People do not speak over you when you cannot articulate your thoughts fast enough.
* You can show affection for your romantic partner in public without fear of ridicule or violence.
* You generally do not worry that your parents/a romantic partner's parents will approve of you/your relationship because of something you cannot change.

## Reflect (10 minutes)

### Self-Reflection

* Select one of the statements that you did not check that you would feel comfortable discussing.
    * When is your experience of not having this particular advantage most pronounced?
    * When are you most comfortable with this aspect of your life?
    * If you were trying to describe that experience to someone else, what would that person need to do to help you continue to feel connected/trusting of them, even if they didn't share the experience?
* Select one of the statements that you did check that you would feel comfortable discussing: when are you most aware of this advantage? What has it given you?
* What statement made you think most? If you could add a statement, what would it be?

### Potential Turing Facing Actions

* How do you use your life experiences when interacting with students/potential students?
* Are there things that you can do welcome students with similar/dissimilar experiences to your own?
* Are there things we could do as a staff?

## Discuss (20 minutes)

Use 10 minutes to discuss and share your answers to the self-reflection questions above, and 10 minutes to share answers to the potential Turing facing actions.


Pick someone to share/document.

Tie to intro/purpose


Meet with a small group of

We'll meet in groups to discuss what came up during our writing. Please be attentive to being respectful, active listeners.

When there are about 10 minutes left, the facilitator will announce the final prompt: _Communication style, gender norms, introversion/extroversion, and learning styles are all areas in which individuals at Turing experience privilege and marginalization. As a group, identify 4-5 scenarios in which you've observed students in your class experiencing similar types of disparities. How well do you think you've done as individuals and as a group to mitigate these disparities when possible or stay connected when they occur?_  Take time to share out some examples from the group.

*EM*
How do you want to do groups? Maybe groups of 3 to keep conversations on track? I can do random groups if you'd like.


## Share (10 minutes)

Start a thread in Slack channel to document Turing facing actions.

## Prep

* Print statements
* Organize groups
