(Please include who is facilitating and how much time you are going to spend in each section):
Introduce the session and goals for the day
Intros - Name, Mod, Why did you come to Turing
Line up in the room from 'most positive' to 'least positive'
     Pair with someone opposite side of the room - discuss things at Turing that make you negative and why 
     Share Out 
Group presenting
     - brain impact of positive and negative thinking
     - How to recognize when you're being salty or something. 
     - Ways to change mindset (also ask group for examples) 
     - Turing positivity and cohort dynamics 
Revisit initial discussion (something negative) and go back to original groups and think of strategies to reframe the situation. 

     Best practices:  No section should be longer than 20 minutes
     Create a session that YOU would want to attend
     Share resources in your slack channel
     All sessions NEED to have a closing activity, reflection, discussion
