## Name of Session: Escaping Your Echo Chamber

## Session Description 

Living in an increasingly polarized society, it has become much harder to understand what has been going on outside of your own bubble, let alone have a conversation with people with opposing ideas. By understanding your echo chamber, you can better understand the people around you and in the process expand your world views.

## Session Outcomes 

- Better understanding of their cognative biases
- An understanding of the backfire effect when viewing opposing content
- An understanding of how social media actively encourages echo chambers

    - Confliciting moral values
    - Discuss: Where do you see echo chambers in your life?
    - Short video on cognative dissonance
