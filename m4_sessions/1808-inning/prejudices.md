## Name of Session: 

## Session Description 

Turing's mission is to unlock human potential by training a diverse, inclusive student body to succeed in high-fulfillment technical careers. In this session we will identify, examine, and discuss our prejudices, biases, and our related experiences with the aim of creating concrete actionable solution to make tech and our broader communities more (inclusive**?)

## Session Outcomes 

(What will students learn/leave with?): 

## Session Outline 
* Intros (10-15 mins) led by entire group. Includes rules for how conversations will elvolve to make a safe space for discussion
* Implicit Bias Tests (10 mins) Students should bring a computer and we will slack them the link for implicit bias tests with instructions to take a test on a topic that they either know very little about or something they feel very 'woke' to.  We haven't decided which way to lean.
* Small Group Discussion (15 mins) Break into 3 small groups, each facilitated by a group member to discuss results, reactions to results, etc
* Recap (5 min) Led by Dream Team. Debrief from small group conversations by sharing relevant points from each group. 
* Regroup (20 mins) led by all 3 group members.  Discuss how this related to tech.  Start with broad example like racist twitterbot and then bring it down to a more personal level with examples from Turing.  Ask what are steps to take when things like this happen in your community.  Discuss potential actions. 
## Recommended Trajectory 

     Best practices:  No section should be longer than 20 minutes
     Create a session that YOU would want to attend
     Share resources in your slack channel
     All sessions NEED to have a closing activity, reflection, discussion
