### Session Outline:


- do we have a responsibility to "give back" to the community?

- what does "giving back" look like?

High level, how helpful this can be

- ever been helped by a blog?
- ever been helped by another student in your cohort or a cohort ahead?
- helped by a teacher?
- a mentor?

We'll talk about how to do all that. 

- OSS contributions (a guide?)
- Write down skills you already have to build confidence
- Find list of places in turing repo where you could find, fix, submit PR w/fix.

Walk through example of PR against Turing repo to fix problem

Walk through example of "student interest group", pairing, be a mentor

Go outside the bubble, volunteer in the community (try turing, etc)
