Session Title: Technology in the Media

Description: Why should students come to this session?

With terms like 'Russian hacking', 'bitcoin', 'net nuetrality' and 'fake news' dominating the news cycle, what can we as developers do to help aid in understanding what these buzzwords actually mean. 

Session Outcomes: What will students leave with or gain from this session?

Students will be able to respond to questions concerning technology topics in the media. Students will lead what we can do as developers to help bridge the understanding for people who lack technical literacy.
