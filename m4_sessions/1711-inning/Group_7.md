## Group Seven

### Session Title: 
Be Your Own Ally

#### Description: 

#### Why should students come to this session?
Turing and life are hard enough. If you are a minority, introverted, or just inexperienced with collaboration, it can be even harder. Women and other minorities in tech many times find themselves in difficult pairings.This session is designed for women and minorities in tech, especially those who don't feel comfortable speaking up for themselves. Participants will build a toolbox of strategies one can use to be a effective self-advocate in pairing and project teams.

- how to advocate for yourself in pairing
- how to respectfully make sure your voice is heard
- how to address microaggressions
- when to involve other people

### Session Outcomes: 

#### What will students leave with or gain from this session?
- Participants will walk away with stratgies to productively address microagressions and any other interpersonal challenges that may arise from a pairing or team.
- Participants will walk away with insight into issues that other students face and reflect on how to also advocate for others
