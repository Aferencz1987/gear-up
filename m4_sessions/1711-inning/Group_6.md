Group Six

Session Title: Just because you can, doesn't mean you should: How to be an ethical technical professional.

Description: Why should students come to this session?
  As technology professional we will have to deal with privacy issues of users we are responsible for providing services for.  There are times where you will have to make a moral decision instead of a legal one.  How do you go about deciding if a legal technical action is moral or not?  Should companies take a moral stand on anything related to the security of their users information?

Session Outcomes: What will students leave with or gain from this session?
  An appreciation for ethical issues involving security and user data and a consideration for circumstances that, while legal, may not be moral.  They will be forced to consider several hypothetical situations where they may be tempted to behave unethically.
