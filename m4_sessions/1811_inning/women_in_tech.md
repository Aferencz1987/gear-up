## Name of Session: Women in Tech

## Session Description 

Learn more about women in tech and their contributions. Learn about your peers' experiences with being women in tech and how we can support them. Gain insight into how you can make a difference. The realization that while there have certainly been a limited number of women in tech, there is also a lack of knowledge about them that has contributed to that thinking.

## Session Outcomes 

What are the different outcomes we have in place? 
-We want students to learn more about the history of women and their contributions to tech.
-We want students to leave with an idea of personal struggles they have experienced or seen relating to inequality or   struggles with women in tech.


### Recommended Trajectory 

     Best practices:  No section should be longer than 20 minutes
     Create a session that YOU would want to attend
     Share resources in your slack channel
     All sessions NEED to have a closing activity, reflection, discussion
