* Video 2: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXtN4y3O35M (5:51 // A quick five minute video analyzing IBM's design thinking approach to Agile development. IBM expands upon traditional design thinking by aiming at meeting the needs of large scale enterprises without sacrificing the personal focus of design thinking. The process starts with the end user and understanding what needs the user has that are not being met. Once a need is identified, the design team writes out as many design ideas as they can think of and slowly weed them out. The one that is left is then given to developers to create a working model.)
