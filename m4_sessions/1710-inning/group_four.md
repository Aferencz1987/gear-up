**Intro**

**Thought Exercise**

***Inform:*** Examples of social movements and the role of technology

_Team members will each present for ~2 minutes on a social movement they care about and, perhaps, how it helps inform our commitments to the greater good of our communities_
- Coders for Bernie
- Arab Spring
- Code For America (Code For Denver)
- Examples of organizations that need help developing technology
- Discussion

***Activate:*** Individual Exercise
- Think about a movement you are passionate about and think about ways you can be involved as a developer - the distinction being that we are focused on how we can use our skills to further the development of technology that helps social movements for good (not use technology)
- Write down some committments you want to make to being an active voice in/contributor to the movements you care about
- Share out
