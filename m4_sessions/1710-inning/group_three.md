## Group Three

### Session Title:

Global Decentralization (work-in-progress)

### Description: Why should students come to this session?

We feel that this is something that will be impacting more and more people as time goes on, and is a really untapped market for development opportunities. Also great for us to be aware of it as developers. 

### Session Outcomes: What will students leave with or gain from this session?

Students will leave with a better understanding of decentralization, how quickly and dramatically our world will change as a whole.  Students will have knowledge of different industry sectors.

### Session Outline:  Include the flow of the session and the time for each section.

Introduce the overarching topic, how to introduce this topic in the best way (?)
Pick different products in different industries - have small group research sessions, and share outcomes with the rest of the class. Leaders spend time facilitate these small group discussions (15-20 minutes)
Cover different sectors of the decentralization movement of our world. Large group discussion of pros and cons of outcomes from this movement. (10 minutes)
Possible wrap-up at end of session, summary of everything we discussed in gear-up session (5-7 minutes).
