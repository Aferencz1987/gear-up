# Getting Better at Difficult Things

## Introduction (2 minutes)
As we watch Kathy Sierra's video and read Ta-Nehisi Coates' article, pay attention to both presenters' assumptions about your agency as a learner. What new ideas do they introduce about 1) your awareness of your learning experience, 2) the efficacy of your learning experience, 3) and your overall mindset as a learner?

## Video (25 min)
Together, we'll watch Kathy Sierra's keynote from [Fluent Conf 2015](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKTxC9pl-WM). You should take notes!

## Read Aloud (5 min)
We're going to read Ta-Nehisi Coates' article, ["Getting Better at Difficult Things"](http://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2015/03/a-quick-note-on-getting-better-at-difficult-things/387133/).

## Write (8 min)
In the context of these presenters' ideas, reflect on the following questions. 
- How are you currently managing your cognitive resources while at Turing?
- How do Sierra's and Coate's material relate to your current process for learning?
- What role does your emotional state of mind play in your learning? 

## Group Discussion (20 min)
As a group, discuss your answers to the questions above. 

What can and will you do to use these ideas to improve your experience as a learner here at Turing?
